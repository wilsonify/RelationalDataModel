# Overarching Rule

You can do what you like, so long as you know what youâ€™re doing.

# Type 
Set of all possible values

* integer
* character
* boolean

# Attributes
Value of a particular type

* 3
* 'a'
* True

# Tuples
Set of Type:Attribute pairs

(int:3, char:'a', bool: 1)

# Relations

Set of Tuples
( 

(int:3, char:'a', bool: 1),

(int:1, char:'b', bool: 0),

(int:5, char:'c', bool: 1),

(int:4, char:'f', bool: 0),

(int:8, char:'z', bool: 1)
)

Schema = ('attribute2':int, 'attribute3':char, 'attribute3':bool)

# Algebra 

a collection of operators that can be applied to relations

* Restrict
* Project
* Product
* Union
* Intersect
* Difference
* (natural) Join

```
project tuples of the form (ingredient, quantity) 

restrict to bacon or eggs
```

# Calculus

what is to be retrieved rather than how to retrieve it

"Give me all the bacon and eggs you have"
