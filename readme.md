The relational model is a database model based on the idea of representing data in the form of tables with rows and
columns. In a relational database, data is organized into tables, also known as relations, and each table contains a set
of rows and columns. Each row represents a unique instance of an entity, and each column represents an attribute of that
entity.

The relational model is based on the concept of first-order predicate logic and the principles of mathematical set
theory. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd in the 1970s, and has since become the most widely used database model.

In a relational database, relationships between data in different tables are established using common fields, called
keys. There are several types of keys in the relational model, including primary keys, foreign keys, and candidate keys.

The relational model is based on the idea of normalization, which is the process of organizing data in a way that
reduces redundancy and dependency. Normalization involves dividing large tables into smaller, more specialized tables
and establishing relationships between them using keys. This helps to eliminate data redundancy and improve the overall
design of the database.

Overall, the relational model is a powerful and flexible way to organize and manage data in a database. It is widely
used in a variety of applications, including business, finance, and scientific research.

In relational database management systems (RDBMS), a key is a field or set of fields that uniquely identifies a row in a
table. There are several types of keys in RDBMSs, including primary keys, foreign keys, and candidate keys.

A primary key is a field or set of fields that uniquely identifies a row in a table and cannot contain NULL values. A
table can only have one primary key.

A foreign key is a field or set of fields that refers to the primary key in another table. Foreign keys are used to
establish relationships between tables and ensure data integrity.

A candidate key is a field or set of fields that could be a primary key in a table, but is not chosen to be the primary
key. A table can have multiple candidate keys.

A join is an operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column or set of columns. There are
several types of joins, including inner joins, outer joins, and cross joins. Inner joins return rows that have matching
values in the joined columns. Outer joins return all rows from one table and any matching rows from the other table.
Cross joins return all possible combinations of rows from the joined tables.
